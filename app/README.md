# webapp

The webapp is running at https://engineer-chat.appspot.com/. The app uses [socket.io](http://socket.io/) to maintain persistent connections.

Note: This app supports a limited set of commands.
`/register <username>`, `/message <>` ,`/enter <room>`, `/leave`

## TODO
- Think of an architecture to allow communication between telnet clients and webapp clients.
- Support more commands.
- Improve UI.
